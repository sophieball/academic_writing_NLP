Beral and Peto\r\n have suggested that they may be due to bias\r\nrelating to artefacts in cancer registration rather than to genuine differences in diagnosis and\r\nmanagement of breast cancer. However, a recent study by M\r\n\u00f8ller et al\r\n has shown that such effects\r\nare unlikely to make a significant contribution to observed differences in survival. The effects of\r\nincomplete ascertainment and registration from death certificates only on survival comparisons based\r\non cancer registry data have been investigated in detail by Robinson et al.\r\nOne important observation in some studies remains unexplained, namely that of poorer survival in UK\r\npatients soon after their diagnosis. Sant et al\r\n demonstrated a higher risk of death in women with\r\nbreast cancer in the UK in the first six months after diagnosis than in other European countries. This\r\nwas particularly pronounced for the youngest (under 29 years) and oldest (over 80 years) age groups.\r\nSix months from diagnosis, survival patterns in the UK became more similar to those in the other\r\nEuropean countries. Further analysis of the survival differential has revealed that disparities between\r\nthe UK and northern European countries (Sweden and Norway) occur mainly for older women in the\r\nfirst year after diagnosis.\r\n Eighty-one percent of the excess UK deaths occur within two years of\r\ndiagnosis.\r\nThe aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with early mortality (within one year\r\nfollowing diagnosis) in a sample of UK women diagnosed with breast cancer during 1996-2005.

In this study a\r\nparticular effort was made to ensure that the surgical status of women was recorded correctly as this\r\nwas considered an important marker of the quality of treatment and was expected to be strongly\r\nassociated with outcome. Time and resource constraints precluded this additional effort being\r\nextended to other variables to verify database entries. However, an earlier study looking at trends in\r\nthe treatment of breast cancer,\r\n concluded that the audit database was a reasonably reliable source\r\nof such data.\r\nThe effects of deprivation on disease severity and ultimately on mortality were not explored in this\r\nstudy. Such analyses rely on potential patient identifiers such as postcode data that were not\r\navailable to us. Deprivation has been linked to poorer patient outcomes for UK breast cancer patients\r\nin several studies\r\n10;29-31  and stated aims of the Cancer Plan and the Cancer Reform Strategy\r\n32-34  are\r\nto tackle the inequalities in cancer survival between different socioeconomic groups in England.\r\nConclusions\r\nOur findings offer more detailed insights into the determinants of death in the first year after a\r\ndiagnosis of breast cancer, a period shown to be important in international comparisons. As expected,\r\nearly death is linked to older age and to the presence of comorbidities. Comorbidities can be\r\naddressed in the long run through general health policy, but two other determinants of early death\r\nidentified by this study are potential avenues for intervention.\r\nFirstly, the findings relating to disease severity lend empirical support to the notion that late diagnosis\r\nis a major determinant of early death. This supports the rationale for projects that focus on increasing\r\nawareness of breast symptoms and the importance of screening. Secondly, surgery is independently\r\nassociated with a large reduction in the risk of early death, and older women were ? independently of\r\ndisease severity and comorbidity - much less likely to receive surgery. Assuming surgery is an\r\nindicator of attempts at curative treatment, there may be benefits of increased treatment activity for\r\nolder women."}}

The majority of women (78%) presented symptomatically, and 82% of those\r\nwith known ethnicity were recorded as white. Over a mean follow up of 5.6 years there were 4,765\r\ndeaths. Table 1 shows the underlying cause of death in these women. 980 women (6.5% of the total)\r\ndied within a year of their diagnosis, and of these 464 women were known to have died from breast\r\ncancer. Amongst those for whom the cause of death was known, there was no significant difference in\r\nthe proportions dying from different causes between those who died within or after the first year since\r\ndiagnosis (chi\r\n = 10.6; 9 df; p = 0.30). However, significantly more of the women who died early had\r\nan unrecorded cause of death (26% versus 12%).\r\nTable 2 describes the characteristics of women who survived one year beyond diagnosis and those\r\nwho did not, and Table 3 shows the results of the logistic regression analyses. In univariate analyses\r\n(chi  values in Table 2 and unadjusted odds ratios in Table 3), older age (>60 years), white ethnicity,\r\ndistant metastases at diagnosis, positive nodes and larger tumours (>20mm) were all significantly\r\nlinked with death within one year of diagnosis (p<0.001 for all chi\r\n tests). Comorbidities on diagnosis\r\nwere also associated with an increased likelihood of early death (Charlson Index\r\n? 2: OR 5.55, 95%\r\nCI 4.56 to 6.76). Women presenting because of symptoms (OR 7.91, 95% CI 5.21 to 12.01) or whose\r\ncancer was discovered incidentally (OR 11.98, 95% CI 7.37 to 19.48) were significantly more likely to\r\ndie early, compared to those whose cancer was identified through screening.\r\nSurgical treatment was associated with highly significantly reduced odds of early death from any\r\ncause (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.14), as was treatment with chemotherapy (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51 to\r\n0.71) and radiotherapy (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.32). There was no significant association between\r\ntamoxifen usage and early death (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.12). The time period in which women\r\nwere diagnosed (before, during or after implementation of the Cancer Plan) was not significantly\r\nassociated with death within a year of diagnosis in univariate models (chi\r\n = 3.54; p = 0.17)."}}
